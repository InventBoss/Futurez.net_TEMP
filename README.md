## Ideas
This game will be written using the [Vue](https://cli.vuejs.org/) CLI

The main gameplay loop will be a "colony builder" where you buy infrastructure to create more money.

Every level will have a money goal and once that goal is reached. When you hit it, the game will prompt you to "travel". Once you travel, the game will reset giving
you a larger building cap and some alien currency that can be used to buy permanent upgrades.
